Piano Roll Studio - Plugins Directory
=====================================

Place your .py plugin files in this directory.
The application will automatically discover and load them.

You can also install additional Python packages:
1. Run 'manage_python.bat' (if using portable version)
2. Or use: pythonpackages\python.exe -m pip install package_name

The app will automatically use packages from the embedded Python environment.
